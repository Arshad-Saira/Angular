      <strong>Reclaim Your Heart</strong> is not just a self-help book. 
		It is a manual about the journey of the heart in 
		and out of the ocean of this life. It is a book about
		how to keep your heart from sinking to the depths of
		that ocean, and what to do when it does.</p><p class="para"> It is a book
		about redemption, about hope, about renewal. Every heart
		can heal, and each moment is created to bring us closer 
		to that transformative return. Reclaim Your Heart is 
		about finding that moment when everything stopsand 
		suddenly looks different. It is about finding your own
		awakening. And then returning to the better, truer, and
		freer version of yourself.
